## What is this?

     A simple script to setup android build tools from a to z & script will finally host Jenkins from your machine
	 
	 Example

     for every machine there will be a ip address

     Let us take

     a pc running on Ubuntu 18.0.4lts

     And ip address of that particular pc is 12.12.12.12 

     Now just copy that ip address and add :8080 at the end

     final your url looks like http://12.12.12.12:8080  And this is your Jenkins url

     Add domain & get SSL certificate :)
  

## Requirements

    Linux

## How to use?
   
    $ chmod a+x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
